# DESCRIPTION:
#
# vfmcpp initial conditions file. Help can be obtained by running run.sh -h.
# 
#	OPTIONS: 
#			
#			path 
#						data folder path relative to vfmcpp root folder (will be created if doesn't exist or emptied if exists)
#			
#			time	
#						total length of time to simulate (s)
#			
#			resl	
#						specify the resolution of the simulation in metres, filaments will be created, default=6.28e-8 (1um radius ring w/ 100 pts) 
#
#			ring [radius, x, y, z, alignment]
#						make a closed filament, requires 4 arguments as above; must have previously specified res,
#						alignment is either 0, 1 or 2 for x, y or z (defaults to z if not given). 
#
#			line [length, x, y, z]
#						make an open filament, requires 4 arugments as above; must have previously specified res
#
#			Eext [strength, duration, direction]
#						include an external electric field, requires 3 arguments where direction is either 0, 1 or 2 for x, y or z.
#
#			q_pt [filament, point, magnitude]
#						add a charge to a filament, requires filaments to be specified eariler in file, 
#						filament is the relative position of the filament in the .in file, (first filament = 0), 
#						point is the index of the desired charged point on the filament, and magnitude is the size of the charge.
#
#			#
#						indicates a comment, which will be ignored by vfmcpp
